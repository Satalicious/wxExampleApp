## Testing with Catch2

Got Catch2? Sweet! Every time you mess with the classes we're testing, `name` runs its tests. So if you break something, we'll know. ðŸš€

## Clean Builds

Old build files hanging around? Ditch 'em. Clean builds = less weird bugs. It's like spring cleaning, but for your code. ðŸ§¹
